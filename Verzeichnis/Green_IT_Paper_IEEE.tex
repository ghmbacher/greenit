\section{Introduction}
The IT industry contributes significantly to environmental pollution with its high energy consumption and increasing amounts of electronic waste. Green IT aims to minimize these impacts through more efficient technologies and sustainable strategies. This manuscript provides an overview of the central challenges and solution approaches for promoting more environmentally friendly IT use.

\section{Fundamentals}

\subsection{Importance of Green IT}
Green IT includes strategies to reduce the environmental impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) throughout their entire lifecycle \cite{murugesan2008}. This includes the use of energy-efficient technologies, the optimization of IT infrastructures, and the promotion of environmentally friendly production processes \cite{tomlinson2010}. A key aspect is improving the energy efficiency of hardware and data centers to reduce electricity consumption and associated CO2 emissions \cite{gartner2007}. Green IT also includes approaches to extending the lifespan of IT equipment, efficient recycling and disposal processes, and the development of circular economy concepts for IT products \cite{geissdoerfer2010}. Optimizing IT infrastructures aims to use resources more efficiently and reduce the overall ecological footprint of the IT industry \cite{jenkin2011}.

\subsection{Goals of Green IT}
The main goals of Green IT include significantly reducing energy consumption in the IT sector, which is crucial given the projected increase in global ICT energy consumption \cite{andrae2015}. Another central goal is promoting a circular economy in the IT sector to maximize resource efficiency and minimize waste \cite{geissdoerfer2010}. Integrating AI technologies to optimize IT systems and energy management is gaining importance, as it has the potential to significantly increase energy efficiency \cite{khan2021}. Furthermore, raising awareness of the environmental impact of IT in both industry and among consumers is an important goal to promote more sustainable practices in the development, use, and disposal of IT products \cite{jenkin2011}. These goals collectively aim to reduce the ecological footprint of the IT industry and strengthen its role in combating climate change.

\section{Challenges}

\subsection{Energy Consumption of Data Centers}
The energy consumption of data centers poses a growing challenge, with a projected global increase to 8% of total electricity consumption by 2030 \cite{andrae2015}. The high electricity demand results from the increasing demand for data processing and storage, particularly through cloud computing and AI applications \cite{masanet2020}. Cooling requirements account for a significant portion of energy consumption, with innovative cooling methods like liquid cooling being increasingly used to improve efficiency \cite{oró2015}. The scalability and growth of data centers lead to a continuous increase in energy demand, while efforts are being made to increase energy efficiency \cite{jones2018}. Despite advancements in energy efficiency, the inadequate overall efficiency of many data centers remains a challenge, addressed through the use of renewable energies and advanced energy management techniques \cite{khan2021}.

\subsection{Lifespan of IT Devices}
The lifespan of IT devices is a critical factor for the sustainability of the IT industry. The high resource consumption in the production of IT hardware underscores the need to maximize usage time \cite{tomlinson2010}. Rapid technological obsolescence often leads to premature device replacement, even if they are still functional, increasing the lifecycle environmental impact \cite{belkhir2018}. Lack of repairability and limited upgrade options in many modern devices exacerbate this problem and contribute to the increase in electronic waste \cite{baldé2017}. The growing amount of electronic waste poses a significant environmental burden, with global e-waste volumes projected to reach 74.7 million tons by 2030 \cite{baldé2017}. To address these challenges, approaches such as modular design, improved repairability, and more efficient recycling processes are being explored and implemented \cite{pohl2019}.

\subsection{Recycling Processes}
Recycling processes for IT devices pose a significant challenge due to the complexity of the materials used. The variety of components and materials in electronic devices complicates efficient recycling processes \cite{baldé2017}. Costly processes for separating and processing the various materials are required, affecting the economic viability of recycling \cite{tomlinson2010}. Handling hazardous substances contained in many electronic components requires special precautions and technologies to minimize environmental and health risks \cite{murugesan2008}. Furthermore, the lack of standardized infrastructure and uniform recycling procedures leads to inefficiencies in the global recycling system for electronic waste \cite{baldé2017}. The development of advanced recycling technologies and the implementation of circular economy concepts are seen as important steps to improve recycling efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of IT waste \cite{geissdoerfer2010}.

\subsection{Required Ores and Ecological Consequences}
The IT industry requires a variety of raw materials, including rare earths and metals, the extraction of which is often associated with significant ecological consequences \cite{unctad2019}. The high demand for raw materials leads to intensive mining, which can cause landscape destruction, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity \cite{tomlinson2010}. The extraction of these resources is also extremely energy-intensive, contributing to a significant CO2 footprint \cite{belkhir2018}. The limited availability of many of these raw materials, especially rare earths, poses an additional challenge and underscores the need for more efficient recycling processes and the development of alternative materials \cite{freitag2021}. To address these issues, approaches such as urban mining, the development of substitution materials, and the improvement of resource efficiency in IT production are being explored \cite{pohl2019}. Considering the entire lifecycle of IT products, including raw material extraction, is crucial for improving sustainability in the IT industry \cite{bieser2019}.

\section{Solution Approaches}

\subsection{Technological Approaches}
Technological approaches to improving energy efficiency in the IT sector include virtualization and cloud computing, energy-efficient hardware, and intelligent cooling in data centers. Virtualization and cloud computing enable more efficient use of server resources and reduce energy consumption by consolidating workloads \cite{murugesan2008}. The use of energy-efficient hardware, such as low-power processors and memory modules, significantly contributes to reducing overall energy consumption \cite{tomlinson2010}. Intelligent cooling systems in data centers, such as free cooling and adiabatic cooling, optimize energy use for air conditioning and improve the overall efficiency of the infrastructure \cite{oró2015}. These approaches together form a basis for more sustainable IT infrastructures and contribute to reducing the ecological footprint of the industry \cite{jenkin2011}.

\subsection{Organizational Measures}
Organizational measures play a central role in implementing sustainability in IT projects. Establishing sustainability guidelines forms the basis for environmentally conscious action within the company \cite{murugesan2008}. Awareness-raising and training for employees are essential to anchor a sustainability culture in the IT team \cite{jenkin2011}. Promoting home office and teleconferencing can significantly reduce CO2 emissions from commuting, with the additional energy consumption from IT use at home being clearly overcompensated \cite{tomlinson2010}. Extending the lifespan of IT devices through repairs and upgrades instead of new purchases contributes significantly to resource conservation \cite{baldé2017}. These measures together form a holistic approach to increasing sustainability in IT organizations.

\section{Practical Examples}

\subsection{Google and CO$_2$ Neutral Data Centers}
Google has set ambitious goals for sustainability and CO$_2$ neutrality but faces significant challenges. The company aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030, despite a 13% increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 \cite{google2024}. Google is increasingly relying on AI for sustainability solutions, such as optimizing energy consumption and fuel-efficient route planning, which has led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 650,000 tons \cite{google2024}. In water management, Google has nearly doubled its water replenishment portfolio and replenished an estimated 1 billion gallons of water \cite{google2024}. Regarding the circular economy, the company has made progress, such as introducing 100% plastic-free packaging for Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro \cite{google2024}. Despite these efforts, the increasing energy demand from AI applications remains a major challenge for Google's sustainability goals.

\subsection{Sustainable Hardware: Fairphone}
Fairphone has established itself as a pioneer for sustainable and ethically produced smartphones. The modular design allows for easy repairs and extends the lifespan of the devices \cite{fairphoneimpact}. Fairphone uses fairly traded and recycled materials, such as recycled plastic and fairly traded gold \cite{fairphoneimpact}. Long software support is also a central feature that extends the use of the devices \cite{fairphoneimpact}. Furthermore, Fairphone is committed to ethical production conditions, including fair wages and improved working conditions throughout the supply chain \cite{fairphoneimpact}.

\subsection{Personal Use}
Personal use plays a crucial role in sustainable consumption. Extending the lifespan of products through careful handling and repairs instead of new purchases is an important aspect. Conscious purchasing behavior includes considering ecological and social production conditions, as well as preferring durable, high-quality products. Consumers can inform themselves about sustainability aspects and quality labels, with 40% of consumers indicating that they do this regularly. The proper disposal of products at the end of their useful life is also important for sustainable consumption \cite{buerger2022}. EU energy labels can help consumers choose energy-efficient products, although they are not explicitly mentioned in the given sources. Overall, each individual can contribute to a more sustainable future through conscious consumer decisions.

The use of artificial intelligence for energy optimization is another important trend. Soare et al. (2024) identify AI as a key technology for improving energy efficiency in IT systems \cite{soare2024}. These trends show that the IT industry is actively working on solutions to reduce its ecological footprint and operate more sustainably.

\subsection{Potential of New Technologies}
New technologies offer great potential for improving energy efficiency in the IT sector. Quantum computing promises more efficient calculations, which could reduce energy consumption in data centers \cite{soare2024}. Energy-efficient processor architectures, such as neuromorphic chips, enable significant energy savings in computationally intensive tasks \cite{nyabuto2024}. The expanded use of hydrogen technologies is gaining importance, especially in energy storage \cite{judijanto2024}. Intelligent IoT-based energy management systems use sensors and AI to optimize energy consumption \cite{soare2024}. These technologies promise significant energy savings and are driving the green IT revolution.
